# ðŸŒŒ A-World-Away-Hunting-for-Exoplanets-with-AI



## NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2025 â€“ Cairo

Using Artificial Intelligence to detect exoplanets from space telescope data (Kepler, TESS, etc.).
Our goal: build AI-powered pipelines to distinguish true planetary transit signals from noise and false positives.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project aims to apply Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to open NASA datasets for exoplanet hunting.
We focus on:

Preprocessing light curve data

Extracting meaningful features

Training classification models

Evaluating performance with real-world metrics

Presenting interpretable results for scientists and the public

## âœ¨ Key Features

End-to-end pipeline for data cleaning, feature engineering, and training

Support for multiple ML models (Random Forest, CNN, Transformer-based models)

Early stopping, class balancing, and learning rate scheduling

Visualization tools for light curves & transit signals

Modular structure for easy extension

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

Kepler Mission Data (NASA Exoplanet Archive)

TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) data

Other open-source exoplanet catalogs

ðŸ‘‰ Links to datasets will be provided in /data/README.md.
